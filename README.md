# Petful FIFO 

This project was created with the intent of pairing a pet with a new home. Petful FIFO works in a First in First out basis and matches prospective owners with the cat or dog that has been in the shelter longest and is next in line. By adding your name, you will be added to the list of people in line, and will be allowed to choose either a cat or dog to adopt when you reach the front of the line.
